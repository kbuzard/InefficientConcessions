# InefficientConcessions
Inefficient Concessions and Mediation is a paper that was part of Ben Horne's (posthumous) dissertation. Kristy Buzard joined the project in 2012 to prepare it for dissertation and then journal submission. Publication would not have been possible without the help of Ben Graham.

The manuscript was conditionally accepted at the Quarterly Journal of Political Science on November 13, 2023. Kristy submitted the revised manuscript on January 22, 2024.

The project is entirely theoretical, but uses some program files for calculations and to help in exploring and proving the propositions.
- This repo also contains referee reports from the EJPE and JCR, to which we submitted before QJPS.

There are three versions of the draft:
1. `draft--conflict_only`. The bulk of the work was done on this file. This .tex file originally came from the Dropbox folder "Ben Horne's Research."
3. `draft`. QJPS suggested we broaden to include cooperations on public goods in addition to conflict. This document contains all but two substantive revisions.
4. `QJPS\Inefficient_Concessions`. Here we implemented QJPS style guidelines (with some help from a freelance editor named Iqra Ameer, who changed the style sheet to APSR) and slightly tightened Corollary 1 and Corollary 2.
   - Note: This version is compiled on Overleaf, project "Inefficient_Concessions." Kristy had some trouble trying to re-compile on a local machine so submitted the PDF from Overleaf.
   - Iqra changed the in-line references to BibTex, so compilation requires Inefficient_Concessions.bib.
